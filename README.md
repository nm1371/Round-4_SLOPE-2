Round-4_SLOPE-2 code is associated to find  a feasible solution of the underdetermind linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
(argmin)   ⁡∑t_i+λ∑r_i       
            t_i≥0,                          i=1,…,n, 
            r_i≥0,                         i=1,…,d,
            || [V(i,1),…,V(i,d)]|┤|_2≤t_i, ,       i=1,…,n,
             ||[(SV)(1,i),…,(SV)(m,i)]||_2≤r_i,         i=1,…,d,      
                L≤V≤U.
Execution process: 'please copy the code in matlab.'
